Animals are classified into various groups based on characteristics. One of the main classifications is vertebrates (animals with backbones) and invertebrates (animals without backbones).

Mammals are vertebrates that are warm-blooded, have hair or fur, and usually give birth to live young. They produce milk to feed their offspring. Examples include lions, dolphins, and humans.

Birds are warm-blooded vertebrates with feathers, wings, and beaks. Most birds can fly, though some, like ostriches and penguins, cannot. Reptiles such as snakes, lizards, and crocodiles are cold-blooded and lay eggs.

Amphibians like frogs and salamanders live part of their lives in water and part on land. Fish are aquatic animals that breathe through gills and typically have scales.

Insects, including bees, ants, and butterflies, are invertebrates. They have six legs and often wings. The animal kingdom is incredibly diverse, with each group adapted to survive in different environments.
