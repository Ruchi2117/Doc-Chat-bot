The Solar System consists of eight planets that orbit around the Sun. These planets, in order of their distance from the Sun, are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

Mercury is the smallest planet and has no moons. Venus, similar in size to Earth, has a thick, toxic atmosphere that traps heat, making it the hottest planet. Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life.

Mars, known as the Red Planet, has the largest volcano in the Solar Systemâ€”Olympus Mons. Jupiter is the biggest planet, a gas giant with at least 79 moons, including Ganymede, the largest moon in the Solar System. Saturn is famous for its prominent ring system made of ice and rock particles.

Uranus rotates on its side and appears blue due to methane in its atmosphere. Neptune, the farthest planet from the Sun, is known for its strong winds and deep blue color.

Pluto was once considered the ninth planet, but was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union.
